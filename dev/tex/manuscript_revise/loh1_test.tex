\subsection{LOH.1 model problem with layered material}
As the final numerical example, we consider the LOH.1 model problem ...

We solve the LOH.1 model problem by using the open source code SW4, where our proposed method has been implemented. To test the performance of the new method, we record the quotient between the computational time of the time stepping procedure  and of  solving the linear system for the mesh refinement interface. We have run simulations on two different computer clusters. First, we use two nodes on the Rackham cluster with each node consisting of two 10-core Intel Xeon V4 CPUs and 128 GB memory. 

To test the performance of our new method
