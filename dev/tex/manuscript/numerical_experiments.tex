\section{Numerical Experiments}
 In Sec.~\ref{convergence_study}, we verify the order of the convergence of the proposed scheme (\ref{elastic_semi_c}, \ref{fine_scheme}, \ref{continuous_sol}, \ref{continuous_traction}). The efficiency of the iterative methods which are used to solve the linear system generated in (\ref{traction_gamma_pre}) and (\ref{traction_gamma_corr}) is investigated in Sec.~\ref{iterative_section}. In Sec.~\ref{gaussian_source}, we show that there is no obvious reflection at the mesh refinement interface for the proposed scheme (\ref{elastic_semi_c}, \ref{fine_scheme}, \ref{continuous_sol}, \ref{continuous_traction}). Finally, the energy conservation property is verified in Sec.~\ref{conserved_energy}.
